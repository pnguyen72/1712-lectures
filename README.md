# COMP 1712 Study Resources

Included in this repo are

- lecture slides
- chapter summaries
- practice quizzes questions and answers.

If you prefer taking a real quiz to reading a list of questions, checkout my [practice quiz web app](https://github.com/pnguyen72/pnguyen72.github.io). It's like the one on Learning Hub, but better.
