# Study resources for COMP 1712

In each folder are

- Lecture slides
- Chapter summary
- Practice quiz questions and answers.

I also include the raw data of each practice quiz, called `quiz-data.json`. They are in the format of

```json
{
    "question 1": ["choice 1", "choice 2"],
    "question 2": ["choice 1", "choice 2"]
}
```

where the first choice is the correct answer.
You may find these useful for scripting
(e.g. giving yourself a real quiz instead of reading a list of questions).
I plan to also eventually upload these scripts, but I don't have time yet; for now, write them yourself.
